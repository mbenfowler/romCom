- No creative ideas? Just hit the "Show Random Cover" button!
- Like the cover you generated? Just hit the "Save Cover" button and view all your romance novel dreams by clicking the "View Saved Covers" button!
- Almost like what you see? You can edit each individual element (cover, title, tagline) by clicking and editing in your own ideas!

### Context:
We had 5 days to complete this project. We are in the Turing Front End Module 1, Cohort 2303. We completed one iteration per day, which left time for refactoring and adding extra features on the last day.

### Learning Goals:
1. Write clean, DRY JavaScript
    - Build out functionality using functions that show trends toward SRP and purity
    - Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
2. Explore the connection between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
    - Practice reading, understanding, and using provided code
3. Write code collaboratively
    - Document changes with atomic commits & thorough code reviews
    - Communicate, troubleshoot, and plan effectively as a team
    - Ensure all team members are able to be heard and contribute throughout the project

### Wins + Challenges:
#### Wins:
1. IT WORKS!!!!!!
2. Communication - as partners, we communicated our time availablity and stuck to our norming contract.
3. Project grooming - making tickets and prioritizing.

#### Challenges:
1. Merge Conflicts - new concept that we walked through together to ensure successful resolution.
2. Balancing time between writing code, refactoring, and learning new concepts entirely (.innerHTML, try...catch, prompt, .tagName, new URL(), event.preventDefault()).
